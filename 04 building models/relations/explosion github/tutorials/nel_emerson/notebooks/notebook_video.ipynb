    "Hopefully, this tutorial has shown you how to implement an Entity Linking component in spaCy. The knowledge base and training dataset used here were kept small for demonstration purposes, but in reality you'll want to use a much bigger representative set of entities, perhaps from an ontology or dictionary that is relevant to your use-case. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have general questions on how to use this functionality in your own application, the best route is to create a new StackOverfow issue and tag it with the label `spaCy`. If you would run into an actual bug with the Entity Linking functionality, you can also open an issue at spaCy's github tracker. \n",

    "I hope your next NLP project will incorporate entity linking !"
